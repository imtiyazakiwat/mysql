## Introduction

PL/SQL is a procedural extension of SQL used for creating stored procedures, functions, and packages within Oracle Database. In this repository, we demonstrate how to create a package containing a procedure that calculates the factorial of a number using a loop.

## Usage

To use the PL/SQL procedure, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Connect to an Oracle Database environment that supports PL/SQL.

3. Open a PL/SQL execution environment (such as SQL*Plus or SQL Developer).

4. Run the provided SQL commands to create the package and package body.

5. Call the procedure within an anonymous PL/SQL block.

6. Check the output to see the calculated factorials.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need an Oracle Database environment that supports PL/SQL. You can use tools like SQL*Plus or SQL Developer to execute the provided PL/SQL code.

1. Make sure you have access to an Oracle Database environment.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Connect to your Oracle Database environment using your preferred PL/SQL tool.

4. Execute the SQL commands provided in the "Usage" section to create the package and procedure.

5. Run the example PL/SQL block to see the procedure in action.

## Programs

The repository includes several PL/SQL programs that demonstrate various concepts and usage of PL/SQL procedures, functions, and packages. These programs can be found in the "Write a PL" folder.

1. Program 1: Execute a single line query and group functions
2. Program 2: Execute DDL commands (Data Definition Language)
3. Program 3: Execute DML and TCL commands (Data Manipulation Language and Transaction Control Language)
4. Program 4: Implement nested queries
5. Program 5: Implement join operations in SQL
6. Program 6: Create views for a particular table
7. Program 7: Write PL/SQL procedure using exception handling
8. Program 8: Write PL/SQL procedure using cursors
9. Program 9: Write PL/SQL procedure using functions
10. Program 10: Write PL/SQL procedure using packages

Each program has its own description and code in the "Write a PL" folder.
